# About the project
### Programming Project #1: Implementing the List Abstract Data Type
  This project was requested by a basic data structure teacher, Selan Rodrigues dos Santos, from UFRN, with the porpuse to implement a List Abstract Data Type.
  In this project was implemented a class called vector that follows the ADT list design and store elements dynamically. Further, was used the Google Tests to verify the correct functioning of each method.

### Installing
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https:://github.com/natanlimap/Vector.git
```
2. On project's root path, delete "build"  

3. Use this command on terminal
```sh
cmake -S . -Bbuild
```
6. Install Google Tests
```sh
https://github.com/google/googletest
```

## Running the tests
1. Enter in the build path

2. On terminal, use this commands
```sh
make
./run_tests
```
## The tests

This tests will show if the implementation of each method of vector class is running as expected.
